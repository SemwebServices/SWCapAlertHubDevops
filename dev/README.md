This directory contains files that will run the necessary componets on a developer workstation


clean up a dev setup with

docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans 

Connect to the postgres instance in the docker container with

docker exec -it cap_dev_pg psql -Ucapcollator capcollatordev

or

docker exec -it cap_dev_pg psql -Ufeedfacade feedfacadedev



If you should edit the DOCKERFILE for any dependent component, remember that they are cached and you will need to run docker-compose build to rebuild
