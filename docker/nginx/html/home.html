	<td width='80%'>Alert-Hub.Org is a small non-profit company with a worldwide goal: 
    help countries assure that people in harm's way get timely and effective emergency 
    alerts so they can protect lives and livelihoods.</td>

  <tr>
	<td width='20%'></td>
	<td width='80%'>Historically, emergency alerts have been text bulletins, 
    composed like a news story. Unstructured text messages make sense for personal 
    communication, but not for automated processing. Although some emergency alerts 
    became digital, the alerts varied by hazard type, language, or country. Timely 
    and effective public alerting at global scale only became feasible in 2001, 
    when the international standard for all-hazards emergency alerting was agreed.</td>

	<td width='80%'>Despite today's amazing telecommunications services, too many 
    people in harm's way still do not get timely and effective emergency alerts so 
    they can protect lives and livelihoods. This gap in alerting is especially acute 
    in least-developed and developing countries, where communities are often the most 
    vulnerable as well.</td>

  <tr>
	<td width='20%'></td>
	<td width='80%'>Alert-Hub.Org addresses ineffective emergency alerting by offering 
    free tools for alerting authorities everywhere to implement the same transformative 
    approach already delivering timely and effective emergency alerts in most countries 
    worldwide. Specifically, alerting authorities are offered free tools enabling their 
    emergency alert systems to leverage the international standard Common Alerting 
    Protocol (CAP).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td width='20%'></td>
	<td width='80%'>A CAP message communicates, in a standard format, the key facts 
    and the recommended actions for any emergency. Use of the CAP format greatly 
    increases alerting efficiency, timeliness, and effectiveness. This is primarily 
    because each CAP alert message carries data designed for machine processing as 
    well as information that humans can read.
